Retrorama Overlay Pack 

Some overlays to use in retroarch with CRT-PI-CURVATURE and CRT-PI-CURVATURE-VERTICAL shaders.
They're made to be used with the core provided resolution and with the above shaders, but you can adjust the screen size if you want to.
Also, it's best to set the overscreen alpha to 1.00, as they already have alpha shadows and crt mask on the image itself.

Not for commercial use.
